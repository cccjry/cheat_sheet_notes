# Working Flow



## Introduction

A programâ€™s **control flow** is the order in which its code executes. The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls. This section presents the *if* statement as well as the *for* and *while* loops. The *if* statement allows you to execute certain lines of code only if a condition is met, and the *for* and *while* loops will execute a block of code repeatedly. At the end of the section, the list comprehension (a way to construct lists that can serve as an efficient alternative to *for* loops) is introduced.
