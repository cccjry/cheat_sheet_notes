# Linux

## Basic

- `ls /` will list the contents of the root directory in the container
- `ps aux` will show running processes in the container
- `cat /etc/issue` will show which Linux distro the container is running
- `exit` is to leave the shell session. This will terminate the bash process, causing the container to exit
